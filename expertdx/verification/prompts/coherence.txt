You will be given an automated diagnostic report for big data anomalies.

Your task is to rate the report based on its coherence.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - This metric assesses both the contextual and logical consistency of the automated diagnostic report. A coherent report should exhibit the following characteristics:
- **Contextual Consistency**: A coherent report should be easy to understand and follow. The language used should be clear and concise, with technical terms and jargon appropriately explained. The report should also provide a clear path of action based on the analysis of the anomaly.
- **Logical Progression**: The report should present a clear and logical progression from the introduction of the anomaly, through its analysis, to the suggested resolution. The information should flow smoothly, with each section logically leading to the next.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the automated diagnostic report carefully.
2. Assess the logical flow of information from the introduction of the anomaly, through its analysis, to the resolution suggestions.
3. Evaluate how well the sections of the report connect and support each other.
4. Assign a coherence score from 1 to 5 based on the criteria.
